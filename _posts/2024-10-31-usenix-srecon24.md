USENIX SREcon is a conference series organized by the USENIX Association, primarily focused on Site Reliability Engineering and related fields in large-scale, high-reliability, high-availability systems. It’s a gathering point for professionals working in SRE, systems engineering, software engineering, and infrastructure operations. SREcon brings together experts and practitioners to share knowledge, best practices, and insights into maintaining the reliability and performance of complex systems.

Many talks cover case studies from major tech companies, this real-world insight is valuable for professionals facing similar issues. The organizers prioritize diversity and inclusion, offering scholarships, mentoring, and programming aimed at underrepresented groups in tech to encourage broad participation.

SREcon serves as a critical venue for networking, professional development, and sharing innovative solutions.

## My Takeaways

Companies aim to leverage mature tools and extract actionable insights from them to maximize value and reduce costs, particularly within observability and incident response. This is a feedback loop that enables increased quality and velocity.

Data governance is a complex topic, whether you’re working with S3, a data warehouse, a data store, a database, big data or something else. In all cases, load balancing, horizontal scaling and distributed consensus are crucial to success.

Development portals are becoming essential as the field evolves rapidly. Commercial solutions are racing to keep up with Backstage’s leadership; however, they are still not sufficiently extensible or customizable to meet all needs.

eBPF has reached maturity, and its application is expanding into use cases I would not have anticipated.

Some engineers seem to have an unusual fascination with Slack, which I don’t share due to its poor UX.
