Converts videos stored in Owncloud at the click of a button.
Simply :
- mouse over a video file
- select the Convert button
- choose a format
- GO !

Side note :
This code is patched and tested for the Owncloud version distributed within Debian Jessie.
https://packages.debian.org/jessie/owncloud

It's no longer needed to manually compile the transcoder:
you'll need FFMPEG from backports and that's all.
https://packages.debian.org/jessie-backports/ffmpeg

This app is based on the work of sbowenwilliams ,
I fixed various issues and customized the functionalities :
