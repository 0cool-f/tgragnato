Converts videos stored in Owncloud at the click of a button.
Simply :
- mouse over a video file
- select the Convert button
- choose a format
- GO !

Side note :
This code is patched and tested for the Owncloud version distributed within Debian Jessie.
You'll need a Libav linked to (at least) the :
- Fraunhofer AAC encoder library [https://github.com/mstorsjo/fdk-aac]
- Lame MP3 encoder library [http://lame.sourceforge.net]
- X264 encoder library for h264 [http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html]

This app is based on the work of sbowenwilliams ,
I fixed various issues and customized the functionalities :
