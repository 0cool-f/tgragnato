# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to Advent of Code 2023! This repository contains my code solutions for the daily challenges provided by Advent of Code. If you're new to Advent of Code, it's an annual event that takes place throughout December, featuring a series of programming puzzles that get progressively more challenging as Christmas approaches.

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl that has been held annually since 2015. Each day leading up to Christmas, a new set of programming puzzles is released. Participants use their programming skills to solve these puzzles and earn stars for successful completion. The challenges cover a variety of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills.
